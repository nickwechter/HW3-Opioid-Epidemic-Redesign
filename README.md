# HW3-Opioid-Epidemic-Redesign

For this assignment I found a chart that I thought could be redesigned to more effectively communicate its message.
Check out the sequence below to see how I approached the process!

I believe that the 3 lines representing 3 major categories of opioids do a great job at communicating the rise of certain types of opioid related overdoses. However, relevant information to the opioid epidemic could be more efficiently commmunicated with a few relativley simple redesigns. I chose to focus my redesigns on enforcing these two aspects of the chart: 
1. The severity of the Opioid Epidemic.
2. Enforcing the "waves" of relevant classes of Opioids

### WireFrame Redesigns

#### Binned Proportions of Opioid Categories

### Process
As the wireframes showed, I spent a good amount of time experimenting with different portrayals of the data, and seeing how different formats extentuated different aspects of the opioid epidemic. One thing that was important to the impact of the message, to me, was changing from the deaths per 100,000 metric used in the original to just using the pure amounts of deaths. I also experimented with displaying the aggregate deaths (in which the Y axis represented the total amount of overdose deaths from previous years), but I thought that this metric made it harder to read into the different "waves" of categories of opioids. I also experimented with binning the different waves of the opioid epidemic (as shown in the "Binned Proportions..." wireframe), but the different time scales of the waves made it hard to maintain the continuous, increasing, curves that make the graphic so powerful.
