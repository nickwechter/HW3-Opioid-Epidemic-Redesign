# HW3-Opioid-Epidemic-Redesign

For this assignment I found a chart that I thought could be redesigned to more effectively communicate its message.
Check out the sequence below to see how I approached the process!

I believe that the 3 lines representing 3 major categories of opioids do a great job at communicating the rise of certain types of opioid related overdoses. However, relevant information to the opioid epidemic could be more efficiently commmunicated with a few relativley simple redesigns. I chose to focus my redesigns on enforcing these two aspects of the chart: 
1. The severity of the Opioid Epidemic.
2. Enforcing the "waves" of relevant classes of Opioids

### WireFrame Redesigns
